			“Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation” is what the acronym Laser stands for, which was created almost 60 years ago, but more recently introduced itself into medicine (Patil and Dhami, 2008, pg. 1). Lasers help to treat a number of different things in medicine,  but are overwhelmingly used in the field of dermatology on the skin. In 2012, only 21% of laser procedures were performed on “nonwhite racial/ehtnic groups”, with 8% being Hispanic, 7% being African American, and 5% being Asian. {lasers and light-based therapies] With a predominant amount of laser procedures being performed on patients with Causaian descent, laser procedures on ethnic skin have risen over the years. Ethnic skin is defined as skin types IV and VI, based on Fitzpatricks Skin Phototypes in Table 1. These skin types have different properties compared to lighters skin types like I or II, which tends to burn easier and never tans. As darker skin types, like skin types IV or IV, barely burns and tans a lot easier compared to lighter skin types. Each skin type when approached with lasers can have very different results due to the presence of melanin in the skin and how widely dispersed it is within the skin. With all skin types being different in their own uniqueness, the use of lasers on each skin type can often vary. &nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p>Since the inception of lasers on the skin, especially in the field of dermatology, lasers were tested on skin types I through III. According to A.F Alexis, the literature on laser and light based therapies focused predominantly on patients with European ancestry and contributed to a lack of information revolving around laser use of different skin types and different racial and ethinic groups. It was shown that when studies and research were performed on people of color it would commonly be performed on patients of East Asian descent, including patients who were Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or Thai (Alexis, 2013, pg. 91). This lead to a lack of research of skin types IV and VI, which tend to be dark skinned patients. It played an enormous role in the factor that affects dark patients outcomes of darker skin types. It is commonly known that patients who have darker skin types tend to present more effects of dyspigmentation. Dyspigmentation like hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and plenty of other pigment issues are more likely to occur in skin types IV and VI. Due to the fact that testing on people of color was very limited still is effecting how lasers are used on pigmented skin. On the other hand, even with the limited testing upon people of color a large factor of lack of testing is due to the “socioeconomic, demographic, and cultural factors” of patients with skin types IV to VI. It was clearly evident during the beginning testing that more Caucaisan and lighter skin types like I through III would predominantly seek laser procedure compared to those who have pigmented skin.</p>

	   <article><h1>What makes lasers influential on the skin?</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif"><span style="font-family: lust-stencil-fine, 'sans-serif;'; font-style: italic;"></span> As lasers have become the new wave of interest in the world of dermatology they have been used on several different procedures performed by dermatologists across the country. The most common being laser hair removal, followed by lasers being used on those who have acne, those wanting tattoo removal, and skin tightening procedures (Alexis, 2013, pg. 91). As laser procedures have been described as being quick, painless, and effective, they seem to always get the job done, especially when it comes to hair removal. Before the occurrence of lasers on the skin many patients disliked these methods because of the pain, discomfort, and how time-consuming they would be. Also, neither would provide lasting results, making it something that needed to be performed constantly.  Lasers would quickly ‘zap’ the skin to perform the desired procedure the patient may want. The huge influence that lasers have on the current dermatology cosmetic market is tremendous. Not only has it changed elements like hair removal, but has also created new effecticeny that is constantly desired by plenty of patients. 
</p>
    
    <p>Each skin type can have a lot of influence from laser procedure that often may raise concern from dermatologists. Skin types I through III based on the Fitzpatricks Skin Phototypes scale in Table 1, are more prone to sun affects the skin and in lighter skin types it shows how skin type I through III are more prone to burning and sun damage. Caucasian skin is more likely to be “prone to ultraviolet light injury”, which plays a role on the effects that can be from laser procedures (Patil and Dhami, 2008, pg. 9). Skin types I through III often can see more effects of burning as that type of skin type is more prone to burning as shown on Table 1. These lighter skin types can see side effects of irreversible texture change or dyspigmentation after a laser procedure (Elsaie and Lloyd, 2008, pg. 1). As this is not always the case of each patient with a lighter skin type, but it shows a great deal of influence laser can create on all skin. On all skin types there is a major risk of pigmentation issues, burns, infections, scaring, and plenty of other issues.According to Uddhave Patil and Lakshyajit Dhami, the effects of lasers can change the erythema, which is damage to the skin that can create redness, hyperpigmentations, and prolonged hypopigmentation from deep scarring, all which can happen on all skin types. So often lasers are created in the media to be good, but they can have a very negative influence on the skin. 
</p>
		   <p>On ethnic skin types there is a specific difference that can lead to more negative outcomes from laser procedures, compared to skin types I to III. Skin types IV to VI,  which are characterized as Eastern Asian, Indian, and Black skin types have more prominence of melanin in the skin. Melanin helps to create the darker pigmentation in the skin. In these ethnic skin types the prominence of melanin is more widely dispersed and due to this high disperence of melanin the skin is more likely to be damaged due to effects of lasers (Alexis, 2013, pg. 92). The structural differences that are apparent in ethnic skin is why laser influence on the skin is more likely to have epidermal injuries. So often the result of those with pigmented skin from lasers result in hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, making the skin appear lighter or darker than its original intent. When the laser treatments are touching the skin it can damage the melanin and also damage how melanin is distributed in the skin. The epidermal damage that is caused by those of highly pigmented skin also damages elements under the epidermis like keratinocytes and the labile melanocytes, which both help to keratin production in the skin and the production of melanin (Alexis, 2013, pg. 92). The pigmentation abnormalities that can be an effect of laser surgery is why the influence laser creates between the different skin types is why there is more concern for ethnic skin types.

	   <article><h1>What changes are occurring that are helping to improve the use of lasers on the skin?</h1>
    <p><span style="font-family: lust-stencil-fine, 'sans-serif;'; font-style: italic;"> </span>Across the field of dermatology, scientists have been improving upon lasers on ethnic skin. The search for lasers without the side effects is now highly desired. There are several different types of lasers on the market currently and it has been stated that one of the best lasers to use on ethnic skin is the 1064 nm laser. This laser uses two different techniques to target deep and penetrated properties. The deep penetrations that this laser provides helps to reach a depth of 5-10 mm that help to not injure the epidermis that was previously common within other types of lasers (Elsaie and Lloyd, 2008, pg. 4). The 1064 nm laser also presents evidence of no “pigmentary changes or scarring”, which is a positive effect especially on ethnic skin types (Elsaie and Lloyd, 2008, pg. 5). Also, a study presented that the 1064 nm laser showed positive effectiveness on skin of color with a low risk of complications (Elsaie and Lloyd, 2008, pg. 5). The improvement of lasers are making it safe for all skin types, especially ethinic skin types. This helps to decrease the side effects like hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, scarring, burning, and plenty more side of effects, which is helping not just ethnic skin but also lighter skin types. </p>
    
    <p>	As the field of dermatology is improving laser treatment for patients, lots is growing in the science behind lasers. The goal is truly to expand the lasers to be used universally on all skin types without the side effects that can often occur. Making a laser have deeper penetration, better thermal advancements, a decrease in downtimes of patients, and see a large reduction in the skin issue is what scientists and dermatologists are working to achieve. With the advancements of such new devices, lights have also been very helpful to treat common issues lasers would previously treat. The device called Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) is on all skin types. The IPL produces a high amount of light to help limit melanin absorption in the skin (Elsaie and Lloyd, 2008, pg. 5). The IPL has been known for its excellent result and during its initial investigation there was no evidence of dyspigmentation reported, which is amazing compared to previous technology (Elsaie and Lloyd, 2008, pg. 5). As the IPL use on skin is relatively newer, there is a concern of the exposure to UV rays that can be potentially harmful for all skin types. Despite the concern the potential for growth is very high for such a new technology.</p>
		 <p>Even with the new improvements in the field of dermatology as it comes to the lasers and lights. There are skin elements that still need improvement in the field. As testing has been done multiple times before being placed on the market, more testing needs to be done on all skin types, especially ethnic skin types. Each set of skin is very different and is structured all very differently, which can play a huge role in the results of a patient. Also the improvement to create better last effects would be better so that patients do not have to endure repeated procedures. Patients that have to have multiple repeated procedures are more at risk of over exposure to harmful light rays, like overexposure to UV light (Prohasha and Badri, 2020). Over repetition of laser and light procedures can increase the likeliness of pigmentation complications. Often pigmentation can take several months to self-resolve. Often patients have to cover and camouflage areas with makeup to match the surrounding area( Prohasha and Badri, 2020). So, its important that the field of dermatology is constantly working to improve upon laser technology so there can be better patient outcomes.
